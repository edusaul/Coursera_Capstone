# 1. Introduction
## 1.1 Background
Now a days it is becoming more frecuent to see people who cares about their health. A consecuence of this is the fact that places related with healthcare, like gyms, have much more attendance than past years. 

On the other hand Chicago is a very big city, plenty of people which spend mos of their time at work and do not have much time left for activities such as coking. Even though there are plenty of good restaurants in any city, most of this places are fast food or, at least, no so healthy food. So, if you want to open a new food bussines, a healthy restaurant sounds like a good idea of bussiness.

Opening a restaurant is a challenging project, so that in order to open such kind of restaurant in a big city like Chicago, one have to care about which is the best location to place it. Data science arises as the needed tool to answer this question. 

## 1.2 Problem
The first step will be to acquire useful data. The density of gyms in different parts of the city can be very valuable info, as the target of the restaurant is people who are likely to go to the this places. To use as location a region of the city where there is a high density of gyms can ensure a good visibility for the commerce.

Chicago is divided in a lot of small neigborhoods. To use one of those areas to choose a location can be too much restictive due to the size. Use instead a cluster of neighboorhoods can be a much better option, because if offers a bigger area to search for a place to locate the restaurant.
