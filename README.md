## Motivation
Now a daysi it's becoming more frecuent to see people who cares about their health. A consecuence of this is the fact that places related with healthcare, like gyms, have much more attendance than past years. Even though there are plenty of good restaurants in any city, most of this places are fast food or, at least, no so healthy food. So, if you want to open a new food bussines, a healthy restaurant sounds like a good idea of bussiness.

In order to open such kind of restaurant in a city like Chicago, one have to care about which is the best location to place it. Data science arises as the needed tool to answer this question. The first step will be to acquire useful data. 

The density of gyms in different parts of the city can be very valuable info, as the target of the restaurant is people who are likely to go to the this places. To use as location a region of the city where there is a high density of gyms can ensure a good visibility for the commerce.

To know the density and kind of restaurants that are popular in the city can be a complmentary information which can also help to make good decissions about the location of the restaurant. A very dense place in terms of restaurants can make a hard competition for a new food place. Try to choose a location where the number of other food places is low should be a good option.
